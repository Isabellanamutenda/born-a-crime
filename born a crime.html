    <h1>RUN</h1>
    <p>IT WAS ON A SUNDAY MORNING……
Have you ever been thrown out of a moving car? Getting thrown out of a moving car that hurts right, but getting up and dust yourself off like it was no big deal that’s humor. Trevor was thrown out of a moving car by his mother on a Sunday when they were coming home from church. Trevor’s whole family was religious and they never missed church. Every Tuesday was prayer, Wednesday was bible study, and Thursday was youth church. Trevor and his mother went to three churches the first church was mixed church where they had jubilant praise, the second church was the white church which Trevor’s mother loved because it offered deep analysis of the scripture and the third church was the mixed church which offered passion and cathartic and made you feel true presence of the holy spirit. Trevor’s mother was caring and courageous when she threw Trevor out of a moving car and she also jumped in order to save their lives.</p>

<h2>BORN A CRIME</h2>
<p>Trevor parents Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah and Robert committed a crime because it was illegal to have a sexual relationship with a person of another race the penalty was five years in prison the government went insane lengths to  try to enforce these laws. Police will drag them out and beat them up but when it comes to white they will assume they were drunk and tell them not to do it again. Trevor’s mother was educated and took a secretarial course  because she could not be a maid or work in the farms which only those were the work of back people could do white color jobs were for  the white people. Many of the prostitutes in town were Xhosa taught Trevor’s mother how to survive and dress up when she lived in town. She met with a German/Swiss man called Robert and when she was with him she felt safe. Trevor’s mother was persistent when she insisted that Robert should give her a child. While others were a proof of love between parents Trevor was the proof of their criminality. When they could go to Soweto Trevor could not get out because the police could take colored kids to the orphanage and the government strip the parents of custody, but when Mandela was elected they were free.</p>

<h3>LOOPHOLES</h3>
<p>I gave birth to the most selfish piece of shit on earth …….
Trevor’s mother chose to have him because she wanted someone to love and something that would love her back unconditionally, but all Trevor did was to cry and eat and shit. Trevor was hyper active and the things he loved was fire and knives one day he burnt himself but he did not see as a big deal. His relationship was like of that of a criminal and a cop because they used to chase each other on the street whenever Trevor makes mistake. Trevor when he was in catholic school he was taken to a psychologist three times to be evaluated. The first time was when he was being beaten by the principal and he started laughing. The psychologist said that he was just creative, independent, and full of energy and he was going to make an excellent criminal or be very good at catching criminals because he could always find loopholes in the law. The second time was when he ate all of Jesus’s body and drink all of Jesus blood and he was not a catholic and he did not see if it was breaking a rule. The third time was when a boy was bullying him and he decided to carry one of his knives to school. Trevor also burnt down a house of the whites while teaching the kid of the whites how to burn a name into piece of wood using a magnifying glass which led to Abel Trevor’s mother boyfriend being kicked out of their garage and Trevor saw that he did nothing wrong and he was innocent. Trevor was blessed with a trait inherited from his mother that to forget the pain in life and figure out something new.</p>

<h4>ROBERT</h4>
<p>After ten years without seeing his father he had to look for him. All he knew about him was that he was a chef, clean and he likes doing things on his own. Robert hated racism and homogeneity or moral superiority to him was insane. Robert dint talk much but he was caring and devoted, attentive to detail. They lost touch when he was thirteen when he moved to Cape Town. Trevor never knew that they will lose touch   he just knew that dad was moving to Cape Town for a bit. Circumstances pulled them apart but he was never not his father. Robert was too private and it was hard to find him. Finally he was able to find him through the Swiss embassy after trying for a long time. They picked from where they left. Robert picked a book and showed him that he was following him. Seeing him had reaffirmed his choosing of him he chose to have him in his life and answer his letter. Being chosen is the greatest gift you can give another human. He spent time with his father and when he was leaving he learnt that his father was extremely secretive.</p>
